# Write For Results

## 1. How to make your document more readability
The secrets are:
* short sentences (Average length - 17 words)
* simple one and two syllable words

## 2. Concise Words

### 2.1 Use Simple Words

### 2.2 Eliminate Zero Words

Zero Words:
> Zero words are words that add nothing--they carry no meaning in a sentence. If you take them out you have lost no meaning.

### 2.3 Replace Long-Winded Words and Phrases

Long-Winded Words are:
* pompous
* abstract
* vague and general

### 2.4 Avoid Standard Confusers

Standard confusers are like:
* former----latter
* and/or
* ______/______
* ______(______)______

Example of former----latter
> "Remember, it is a matter of comparing apples to oranges. The latter always comes out ahead of the former."

## 3. Dynamic Verbs

Dynamic verbs give your writing power to achieve action.

Nouns and other words do not generate action.

Corporate Speak:
> Corporate Speak means bureaucratese

To prevent your writing from suffering from "corporate speak" and to write using only dynamic verbs, you need to **eliminate nounisms** and **avoid using weak verbs**.

### 3.1 Eliminate Nounisms

A nounism is a nice verb, hidden within a noun. For example, the word **cooperation** is noun. Within that noun is a dynamic verb **cooperate**.

How to eliminate nounisms:
> look for words ending in -tion, -ment, -able, -ing.

### 3.2 Avoid Weak Verbs

Weak and Passive Verbs are:
* be
* are
* appear
* become
* seem
* seems to be
* was
* were

When you write with these weak, passive verbs, you miss an opportunity to add energy and verve to your document.

Question these weak verbs:
* Obtain, conduct, provide
* results in
* itis
* there is, there are
* was or were
* have or has
* do or does
* make

## 4. Use Upfront Actors

Upfront Actors:
> The "actor" precedes the "action".  
> For example, if you write, "Grace will fly to Washington today," Grace is the upfront actor and "flying" is the action.

Absent Actors:
> A sentence which contains an absent actor, lacks clarity and accountability regarding who is responsible for the action.

Delayed Actors:
> In a sentence with a delayed actor, the action, or verb, precedes the actor.

So:
- Upfront actors give you:
  * the active voice }
  * dynamic verbs Results
  * clear action
- Delayed or absent actors give you:
  * the passive voice }
  * weak verbs Diplomacy
  * vague action

### Phases to Avoid

Avoid these phrases as much as possible:
* There is
* There are
* It is

These phrases almost force you to write with absent and delayed actors.

Note:
> You can legitimately use absent and delayed actors when you want to write diplomatically and avoid writing too bluntly.

## 5. Structure

Follow a writing process:
* Gather information
* Categorize content
* Choose a format
* Revise at the end

Use a format:
* Choose persuasive or informative
* State the **What** before the **Why** and **How**
* Put conclusions and main message upfront

### 5.1 Informative Format

* Introduce subject and context
* State topics 1, 2, 3
* Give details
  * Topic 1
  * Topic 2
  * Topic 3
* Summarize topics 1, 2, 3
* Propose next steps

### 5.2 Persuasive Format

* State main message – the present
  * Introduce topic and state message
* Give background – the past
  * Explain what led to the message
* Expand message – the future
  * Describe future impact and benefits to reader
* End quickly – the future
  * Include next steps: who does what by when

## 6. Key Questions to Establish Tone

### Who is my one reader?

* Supervisor? Peer? Direct report?
* Internal or external?
* Creative or conventional?

### What is my reader’s communication style?

* Details vs. bottom line
* Tasks vs. relationship

### What is my purpose?
* Positive message?
  * Use dynamic verbs, upfront actors
* Negative message?
  * Use weak verbs; absent and delayed actors

### Will the tone undermine or help the communication?

## 7. Design and Tone – Summary

Design reader-friendly sentences and paragraphs
* Use white space and bullets
* Get specific and descriptive with headings
* Keep paragraphs short - 5-7 sentences

Consider your reader and purpose
* Your reader: peer, superior, internal or external?
* Your purpose: positive or negative document?
  * Direct vs. indirect approach

Enhance tone
* Write to one reader
* Use personal pronouns
  * Two “yous” for every one “I” ▪ Vary sentence lengths
